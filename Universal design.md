| Principle | Core Idea | Real-Life & Digital Examples |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **1\. Equitable Use** | Same means of use for all; avoids stigmatizing. | **Physical:** **Ramps and elevators** that allow everyone to enter together. **Digital:** Video captions that assist both deaf users and those in quiet libraries. |
| **2\. Flexibility in Use** | Choice of methods; accommodates right/left hand. | **Physical:** ATMs with both tactile dials and touchscreens. **Digital:** Software that allows navigation via either mouse or keyboard. |
| **3\. Simple & Intuitive Use** | Easy to understand regardless of language/literacy. | **Physical:**Universal symbols on public signs (e.g., a "Restroom" icon). **Digital:** A search bar that is always at the top right of a site. |
| **4\. Perceptible Info** | Redundant cueing (visual, tactile, audio). | **Physical:** Doorbells that have flashing lights as well as audio cues for visitors. **Digital:** Screen readers that turn visual text into speech for visually impaired users. |
| **5\. Tolerance for Error** | Prevents or permits "undoing" of mistakes. | **Physical:** Sensors on elevator doors that prevent them from closing on someone. **Digital:** The "Undo" function in document editors to reverse a mistake. |
| **6\. Low Physical Effort** | Minimal force; prevents fatigue. | **Physical:** Lever-style door handles that can be opened with an elbow or a closed fist. **Digital:** Auto-complete search that reduces the number of keystrokes needed. |
| **7\. Size and Space** | Accessible reach and clear line of sight. | **Physical:** Clear floor space in front of an ATM for a wheelchair user to turn around. **Digital:** Clickable areas (links/buttons) that are spaced far enough apart to avoid mis-clicks. |
