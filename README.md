This is my collection of materials I've found about accessibility, mostly for frontend development but also for general understanding. 

I add dates to links, because this can be useful as information quickly becomes outdated.

## How to

### hide content from screen readers
* [aria-hidden](https://a11y-101.com/development/aria-hidden), if you want the content to be accessible to the sighted


### hide visual content 
For example, some description for visual impared users that you want to hide from screen
* screen-reader-only class for css, [examples](https://github.com/LinkedInLearning/simplifying-web-development-with-accessibility-best-practices-2883015/blob/main/03_02/index.html)

### make accessible hamburger menu
